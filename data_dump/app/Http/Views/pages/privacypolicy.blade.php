                        <p>We also provide a secure server. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is used to transmit all

                            database for the payment gateway. Only those with special access and authorization can access
                            these systems and they are required to maintain all information as confidential.</p>
                        <p>Following a transaction, no private information is stored on the servers, including but not
                            limited to social security numbers, financials, and credit cards.</p>
